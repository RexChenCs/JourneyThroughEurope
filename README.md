Game description:
A travelling game. Each player has a home city and draws 6 cards for other cities that they must visit by a combination of land, sea and air travel. 
A die is used to move, but players choose their routes.
The limitation of using only one mode of transportation per turn increases the analysis and decisions a bit more. 
The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins.
